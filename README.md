# language_game

This is one of my fun side projects: creating a small language game using Pygame.

The goal is simple: tell me which alphabet corresponds to the one on the picture. 
Easy you might think? Wait until you get questions on the numerous Indic, Ethiopic and Hanzi alphabets!

This project is a work in progress. What I will be working on in the next few weeks:

- Improving game interaction by making the interface more dynamic
- Adding a score counter
- Enriching the content by adding new exciting alphabets

How to run the game:
- Simply copy the repository to your computer
- Run the file language_game.py

Note: you will need Python3 and the Pygame package to run this game

Have fun!
